 * Per-user sandbox provisioning + seeding — pure fetch, Workers-native (no rebyte-sandbox SDK; it
 * pulls node fs/tar into the bundle, AND its gRPC transport sends gateway headers that 401 against
 * rebyte's envd — both verified, see removeFile).
 *
 * The SKILL is no longer seeded here: cctools skills v3 installs `simplifly-flyai-skill` from GitHub into the
 * VM (worker/task-do.ts `SKILL_REF` → POST /v1/tasks `skills`). This file now only writes the two
 * genuinely per-deployment/per-user things — the VM system prompt (/code/CLAUDE.md) and the per-user
 * `.simplifly.env` credential — plus one-time cleanup of the retired skill tree on reused sandboxes.
 *
 *   provisionComputer() → POST /v1/agent-computers (rebyte relay API)
 *   writeFile()         → POST https://49983-<sandboxId>.<domain>/files          (envd REST)
 *   removeFile()        → POST https://49983-<sandboxId>.<domain>/filesystem.Filesystem/Remove
 *                         (envd gRPC-Web — REST /files has no DELETE, returns 405)
 *
 * The envd file API takes a multipart `file` field, auth via the sandbox's own X-API-KEY, and
 * auto-creates parent dirs — all verified against a live sandbox.

 *  Core Boundaries. This REPLACES cctools' default system_prompt.md, whose generic guidance steers
 *  the agent to web search instead of our skill.
 *
 *  CRITICAL ordering bug we MUST defeat: the relay seeds /code/CLAUDE.md as a SYMLINK
 *  → /home/user/system_prompt.md during VM creation (cctools `seedClaudeMdSymlink`, called inside
 *  `provisionVM` → `createNew`). That runs BEFORE we ever write — `sandbox_id` only surfaces to our
 *  poll AFTER the relay's create transaction (which contains the symlink seeding) commits. So by the
 *  time we have a sandbox to write to, /code/CLAUDE.md is ALREADY that symlink, and BOTH envd file
 *  ops FOLLOW it: a plain write lands in system_prompt.md (which the relay's `writeSystemPrompt`
 *  re-clobbers with its generic meta.md on EVERY prompt → our VM system prompt is silently lost and
 *  the agent web-searches), and a single gRPC Remove deletes the symlink's TARGET, leaving a
 *  DANGLING symlink at /code/CLAUDE.md (verified against a live sandbox: after one Remove both
 *  CLAUDE.md and system_prompt.md 404). A subsequent write would then re-follow the dangling link
 *  and recreate system_prompt.md — same trap.
 *
 *  So we Remove TWICE: the 1st follows the link and deletes the target (link goes dangling); the 2nd
 *  finds a dangling link with no target to follow and deletes the LINK ITSELF. Only then is the path
 *  clear for a REAL regular file that envd can't follow anywhere. The relay only seeds the symlink in
 *  `createNew` (never on reconnect) and `writeSystemPrompt` only ever touches system_prompt.md, so a
 *  real file here can no longer be clobbered. removeFile treats absent (grpc-status 5) as a no-op, so
 *  the 2nd Remove is harmless when the 1st already cleared everything, making this safe on fresh,
 *  re-seed, and reused sandboxes alike. */

 *     FIRST and shadows the fresh home copy — using a stale token after a rotation.
