/**
 * The flight skill — a plain GitHub repo URL, installed by the relay (cctools skills v3) via
 * `skills add`, which installs ALL skills under the repo (currently just rebyte-flight, in
 * skills/rebyte-flight/). Stored/edited/displayed WITHOUT the `github:` prefix so a user just
 * copy-pastes a normal GitHub URL; `toSkillRef` adds the `github:` routing tag the /v1 `skills`
 * param needs, right before we send it (the relay strips that tag and hands the URL verbatim to
 * `skills add`, so a failure is a `skills add` failure).
 *
 * Private repo → the relay clones it with the org's GitHub token (bound in the rebyte UI). Tracking
 * `main`: push to the repo to update; the next new session re-clones — zero travelkit rebuild/redeploy.
 *
 * (To install just ONE skill from a multi-skill repo, paste a `/tree/<branch>/<subdir>` skill-
 * directory URL instead — `skills add` scopes discovery to that subpath.)
 *
 * Shared by the production worker (worker/task-do.ts) and the CLI probes (server/rebyte/*).
